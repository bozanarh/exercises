## Exercises

### [Exer1](https://github.com/bozanarh/exercises/blob/master/Exer1.java)

**Exer1** - You have a ladder n-steps in height.  You can either take one step or two
steps up the ladder at a time.  How can you find out all the different
combinations up the ladder?  Then figure out an algorithm that will actually
print out all the different ways up the ladder.  ie: 1,1,2,1,2,2... etc...


### [Exer2](https://github.com/bozanarh/exercises/blob/master/Exer2.java)

**Exer2** - Write an algorithm to calculate the square root of a number.


### [Exer3](https://github.com/bozanarh/exercises/blob/master/Exer3.java)

**Exer3** - Given an array of integers, write a method that returns an array of the
same size where each index is the product of all integers except itself, i.e.
given array {1,2,3,4} return {24,12,8,6} explicitly {2*3*4,1*3*4,1*2*4,1*2*3}.


### [Exer4](https://github.com/bozanarh/exercises/blob/master/Exer4.java)

**Exer4** - Give an array of 100 random integers. Write an algorithm to find the the
closest 2 integers (closest by position) in the array that add up to 100.


### [Exer5](https://github.com/bozanarh/exercises/blob/master/MyList.java)

**Exer5** - Given the root node to a singly linked list, write an algorithm to detect
if there is a loop in the list.


### [Exer6](https://github.com/bozanarh/exercises/blob/master/Exer6.java)

**Exer6** - Given the function: "bool numExists( int array[], int array_len, int num )"
where "array" is a sorted array of integers.  Determine if "num" exists in the
array.
